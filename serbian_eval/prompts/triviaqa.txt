I would like you to help me refine an existing translation from Google Translate from English into Serbian (Latin script).

Google translation often has grammatical, syntax errors as well as demonstrations of a basic lack of world knowledge that cause poor translations.

Before you give the final Serbian translation in Latin script ensure you provide step-by-step reasoning for why the Google Translation failed.
If the translation is good, explain why it is a good translation and proceed to generate a correct, high-quality translation.

Make sure you first reason before outputting the final Serbian translation. During your reasoning process append each of the 4 choices to the original query and make sure it fits perfectly according to Serbian grammar. Translations need to be fluent.

Output format should be:

REASONING:
[your reasoning goes here, use bullet points]
SERBIAN:
"query": refined query goes here
"choice1": refined choice 1 goes here
"choice2": refined choice 2 goes here
"choice3": refined choice 3 goes here
"choice4": refined choice 4 goes here

Note: query and choices are obviously related so do use the information in "query" to help you translate "choice1"/"choice2"/"choice3"/"choice4" and vice versa.
You must be able to append any of the 4 choices and get a cohesive, naturally sounding sentence.

Remember: All output text should be in Serbian except that "REASONING", "SERBIAN", "query", "choice1", "choice2", "choice3", "choice4" are special tokens that must not be translated.

Bellow is the input (both original in English and output from Google Translate). Generate a high quality correct translation.

ENGLISH:
"query": {src_query}
"choice1": {src_choice1}
"choice2": {src_choice2}
"choice3": {src_choice3}
"choice4": {src_choice4}

SERBIAN (GOOGLE TRANSLATE):
"query": {trg_query}
"choice1": {trg_choice1}
"choice2": {trg_choice2}
"choice3": {trg_choice3}
"choice4": {trg_choice4}
