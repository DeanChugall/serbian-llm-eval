I would like you to help me refine an existing translation from Google Translate from English into Serbian (Latin script).

Google translation often has grammatical, syntax errors as well as demonstrations of a basic lack of world knowledge that cause poor translations.

Before you give the final Serbian translation in Latin script ensure you provide step-by-step reasoning for why the Google Translation failed.
If the translation is good, explain why it is a good translation and proceed to generate a correct, high-quality translation.

Make sure you first reason before outputting the final Serbian translation.

Output format should be:

REASONING:
[your reasoning goes here, use bullet points]
SERBIAN:
"goal": refined goal goes here
"choice1": refined choice 1 goes here
"choice2": refined choice 2 goes here

Note: goal and choices are obviously related so do use the information in "goal" to help you translate "choice1"/"choice2" and vice versa.
The "goal" together with "choice1" or "choice2" should form a cohesive, naturally sounding text.

Remember: All output text should be in Serbian except that "REASONING", "SERBIAN", "query", "choice1", "choice2" are special tokens that must not be translated.

Bellow is the input (both original in English and output from Google Translate). Generate a high quality correct translation.

ENGLISH:
"goal": {src_goal}
"choice1": {src_choice1}
"choice2": {src_choice2}

SERBIAN (GOOGLE TRANSLATE):
"goal": {trg_goal}
"choice1": {trg_choice1}
"choice2": {trg_choice2}
