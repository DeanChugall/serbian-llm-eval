I would like you to help me refine an existing translation from Google Translate from English into Serbian (Latin script).

Google translation often has grammatical, syntax errors as well as demonstrations of a basic lack of world knowledge that cause poor translations.

Before you give the final Serbian translation in Latin script ensure you provide step-by-step reasoning for why the Google Translation failed.
If the translation is good, explain why it is a good translation and proceed to generate a correct, high-quality translation.

EXAMPLES:

ENGLISH:
"question": who is the girl in green day 21 guns
"answer": ['Lisa Stelly', 'Rihanna', 'Nicki Minaj', 'Judy Garland']

SERBIAN (GOOGLE TRANSLATE):
"question": ko je devojka u zelenom dejstvu 21 oružje
"answer": ['Lisa Steli', 'Rijana', 'Niki Minaž, 'Džudi Garland']

REASONING:
* This translation is not correct because it took the name of the band "Green Day" and translated it into Serbian "zelenom dejstvu" instead of just keeping the original English name.
* Similarly for 21 guns, that's the name of the song so it should not be translated into "21 oružje".
* Finally albeit this is a fine detail the "answer" should likely be "Liza Steli" and not "Lisa Steli" as that's how the name is pronounced in Serbian.
SERBIAN:
"question": Ko je devojka u pesmi "21 guns" grupe Green Day?
"answer": ['Liza Steli', 'Rijana', 'Niki Minaž, 'Džudi Garland']

ENGLISH:
"question": when was the last time anyone was on the moon
"answer": ['14 December 1972 UTC', 'December 1972', '13-th of August 1969', 'yesterday']

SERBIAN (GOOGLE TRANSLATE):
"question": kada je neko poslednji put bio na Mesecu
"answer": ['14. decembar 1972. UTC', 'decembra 1972. godine', 'trinaestog avgust 1969', 'juce']

REASONING:
* 'trinaestog avgust' is not a good declension it should be 'trinaestog avgusta'.
* 'juce' is misspelled and should use the Latin letter č, i.e. 'juče' instead of 'juce'.
SERBIAN:
"question": kada je neko poslednji put bio na Mesecu
"answer": ['14. decembar 1972. UTC', 'decembra 1972. godine', 'trinaestog avgusta 1969', 'juče']

ENGLISH:
"question": Question: Centuries ago, people used their knowledge of the stars to\nAnswer:
"answer": ['navigate ships.', 'study the weather.', 'predict volcanic eruptions.', 'map the Earth's surface.']

SERBIAN (GOOGLE TRANSLATE):
"question": Pitanje: Pre nekoliko vekova ljudi su koristili svoje znanje o zvezdama\nOdgovor:
"answer": ['ploviti brodovima.', 'proučavati vremenske prilike.', 'predviđaju vulkanske erupcije.', 'mapirati površinu Zemlje.']

REASONING:
* The question was not translated properly, the suffix "kako bi" needs to be added so that the "question" and "answer" sound naturally.
* Additionally one needs to modify the "answer" such that we restore the narrative flow of the sentence. Use "plovili" instead of "ploviti", etc.
SERBIAN:
"question": Pitanje: Pre nekoliko vekova ljudi su koristili svoje znanje o zvezdama kako bi\nOdgovor:
"answer": ['plovili brodovima.', 'proučavali vremenske prilike.', 'predviđali vulkanske erupcije.', 'mapirali površinu Zemlje.']

Make sure you first reason before outputting the final Serbian translation. Be even more verbose and thorough than in the above examples.

Output format should be:

REASONING:
[your reasoning goes here, use bullet points]
SERBIAN:
"question": refined translation goes here
"answer": ['refined answer 1', 'refined answer 2', 'refined answer 3', 'refined answer 4']

Note: question and answer are obviously related so do use the information in "question" to help you translate "answer" and vice versa.

Remember: All output text should be in Serbian with some exceptions as shown in the examples above. "REASONING", "SERBIAN", "question", "answer" are special tokens that must not be translated.

Bellow is the input (both original in English and output from Google Translate). Generate a high quality correct translation.

ENGLISH:
"question": {src_question}
"answer": {src_answer}

SERBIAN (GOOGLE TRANSLATE):
"question": {trg_question}
"answer": {trg_answer}
