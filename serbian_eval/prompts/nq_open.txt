I would like you to help me refine an existing translation from Google Translate from English into Serbian (Latin script).

Google translation often has grammatical, syntax errors as well as demonstrations of a basic lack of world knowledge that cause poor translations.

Before you give the final Serbian translation in Latin script ensure you provide step-by-step reasoning for why the Google Translation failed.
If the translation is good, explain why it is a good translation and proceed to generate a correct, high-quality translation.

EXAMPLES:

ENGLISH:
"question": who is the girl in green day 21 guns
"answer": ['Lisa Stelly']

SERBIAN (GOOGLE TRANSLATE):
"question": ko je devojka u zelenom dejstvu 21 oružje
"answer": ['Lisa Steli']

REASONING:
* This translation is not correct because it took the name of the band "Green Day" and translated it into Serbian "zelenom dejstvu" instead of just keeping the original English name.
* Similarly for 21 guns, that's the name of the song so it should not be translated into "21 oružje".
* Finally albeit this is a fine detail the "answer" should likely be "Liza Steli" and not "Lisa Steli" as that's how the name is pronounced in Serbian.
SERBIAN:
"question": Ko je devojka u pesmi "21 guns" grupe Green Day?
"answer": ['Liza Steli']

ENGLISH:
"question": when was the last time anyone was on the moon
"answer": ['14 December 1972 UTC', 'December 1972']

SERBIAN (GOOGLE TRANSLATE):
"question": kada je neko poslednji put bio na Mesecu
"answer": ['14. decembar 1972. UTC', 'decembra 1972. godine']

REASONING:
* This translation is very high quality.
* 'decembra' is a good declension of the noun "decembar"
SERBIAN:
"question": kada je neko poslednji put bio na Mesecu
"answer": ['14. decembar 1972. UTC', 'decembra 1972. godine']

ENGLISH:
"question": who was the ruler of england in 1616
"answer": ['James I']

SERBIAN (GOOGLE TRANSLATE):
"question": koji je bio vladar Engleske 1616
"answer": ['Džejms I']

REASONING:
* The translation of "who" into "koji" is incorrect. In Serbian one would use "Ko je bio" here instead of "Koji je bio".
* That's the only mistake everything else looks good. "Džejms" is a correct translation of "James" in Serbian.
SERBIAN:
"question": Ko je bio vladar Engleske 1616. godine?
"answer": ['Džejms I']

Make sure you first reason before outputting the final Serbian translation. Be even more verbose and thorough than in the above examples.

Output format should be:

REASONING:
[your reasoning goes here, use bullet points]
SERBIAN:
"question": refined translation goes here
"answer": ['refined answer 1', 'refined answer 2', ...]

Note: question and answer are obviously related so do use the information in "question" to help you translate "answer" and vice versa.

Remember: All output text should be in Serbian with some exceptions as shown in the example above. "REASONING", "SERBIAN", "question", "answer" are special tokens that must not be translated.

Bellow is the input (both original in English and output from Google Translate). Generate a high quality correct translation.

ENGLISH:
"question": {src_question}
"answer": {src_answer}

SERBIAN (GOOGLE TRANSLATE):
"question": {trg_question}
"answer": {trg_answer}
