I would like you to help me translate English into Serbian (Latin script).

You are given a translation from Google translate as a source of inspiration, but bear in mind that it often has grammatical, syntax errors as well as demonstrations of a basic lack of world knowledge that cause poor translations.

Output format should be:

SERBIAN:
"passage": refined passage goes here
"question": refined question goes here

Remember: All output text should be in Serbian except that "SERBIAN", "passage", and "question" are special tokens that must not be translated.

Bellow is the input (both original in English and output from Google Translate). Generate a high quality correct translation in Serbian.

ENGLISH:
"passage": {src_passage}
"question": {src_question}

SERBIAN (GOOGLE TRANSLATE):
"passage": {trg_passage}
"question": {trg_question}
